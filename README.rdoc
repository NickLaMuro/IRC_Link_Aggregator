== IRC Link Aggregator

This bot can be used to grab links an post them to your tumblr/delicious accounts.

== Running it

It runs with straight Ruby.  You'll need the Cinch gem and Ruby 1.9.  It also requires a YAML file that holds all of the account information.  Place it in the root directory with the name of 'account.yml'.  Format should look something like this:

=== account.yml

  irc_settings:
    server: irc.freenode.org
    nick: Your_Bot_Name_Here
    channel: Your_Channel_Name_Here
  delicious_settings:
    username: Your_Delicious_Username_Here
    password: Your_Delicious_Password_Here
    shared: false
    replace: false
    tags:
      - tag1
      - tag2
  tumblr_settings:
    username: Your_Tumblr_Email_Here
    password: Your_Tumblr_Password_Here

Then just run it with

  ruby bot.rb
